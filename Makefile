# Development tasks.  Run `make' to check everything, as the CI does.
#
#   make compile   byte-compile, warnings are errors
#   make lint      package-lint, the MELPA rules
#   make relint    the regular expressions and the docstring escapes
#   make test      ERT test suite
#   make tty       box drawn in a real terminal, needs python3 + pyte
#   make gui       box measured pixel by pixel, needs a display + pillow
#   make clean     remove build output and the tool sandbox
#
# The indent, checkdoc and complexity checks are pre-commit hooks of
# https://github.com/MArpogaus/elisp-complexity, not targets here.
#
# The checks install their tools and this package's dependencies into
# $(SANDBOX), so a fresh checkout needs nothing but Emacs and make.

# way leaves the directory behind, and a directory target would then
# count as made and the tools stay missing.

# Elisp programs live in variables: make joins their continuation lines,
